To use Yarn to run a React script, follow these steps:

First, make sure that you have installed Yarn on your computer. If you haven't, you can install it by running the following command:
npm install --global yarn

Once Yarn is installed, navigate to your React project directory in the terminal.

To start your React project, run the following command:
yarn start

This will start your React project and open it in your default web browser. The command will also watch for changes in your code and automatically update the application in the browser.
